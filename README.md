## General Info

This is a simple frontend boilerplate to compile postcss to css. It additionally uses live-server to set up a live-server, but assumes you have live-server installed globally (if you don't, go do that). There is no css minification, as this is not intended to be used in real production environments. You might use this if you wanted a CodePen-esque setup but want to work in a code editor.

## Setup

Simply clone this repo, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Scripts

Here is our sole script:

#### `npm run css`

Sets up a file watch that compiles postcss into css.
